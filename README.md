# SMART.
Repo for the development of a Web-App to manage SMART goals

The Goal of this Web Application is to give its user an intuitive tool that he can use 
to track his SMART Goals. It should deliver graphical information about his progress and
weekly/monthly feedback so that he knows how he's doing and if he needs to adjust.
